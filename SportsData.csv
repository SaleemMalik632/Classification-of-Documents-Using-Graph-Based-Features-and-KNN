I'll always be able to throw the ball.""So, to come in for a little bit, like MJ [basketball legend Michael Jordan] coming back, I don't know if they would let me but I wouldn't be opposed to it.""Brady is the NFL's all-time regular-season leader in pass attempts (12,050), completions (7,753), passing yards (89,214) and touchdown passes (649).

Louis Rees-Zammit: Former Wales rugby star keen to prove worth in 'cut-throat' NFL,"Louis Rees-Zammit says he is ready to show everyone what he can do to avoid being axed by Kansas City Chiefs in the ""cut-throat"" NFL.The former Wales rugby wing, 23, joined the reigning Super Bowl champions on a three-year contract in late March.He is now bidding to earn a place in the Chiefs' 53-man roster for the upcoming season.""You can get cut at any point so it's a bit of a cut-throat sport,"" Rees-Zammit told The Rugby Pod.""I could go to pre-season now, not do well and just get cut straight away.""Rees-Zammit will earn £634,000 if selected in the Chiefs' roster for the season ahead compared to £199,500 if he is in the team's practice squad.""As a rookie you sign a three-year deal and you get guaranteed money,"" he added.""So if you get injured or you get cut, you're still guaranteed that money.""You're not guaranteed the three years at all - and no-one is.""I just need to make the 53-man squad now.

That's where my main position will be and I've got to fight to start in that position this year,"" he said.""And then within the offence it's about how quick I can learn the playbook.""We've got a plan to put me in various positions, play out the backfield at running back, be a slot receiver.

NFL: Charlie Smyth wants to shine on world stage after earning New Orleans Saints deal,"Charlie Smyth's head was all over the place.This was his big opportunity and the wait to find out if his dream had been realised or shattered was proving torturous.Life has moved really fast for Smyth over the past year. Hailing from the village of Mayobridge, Smyth was at one stage training to be a teacher and playing a bit of Gaelic football, the sport he has played all his life.But after deciding to pursue his dream of becoming an American footballer, Smyth found himself in New Orleans, 4,000 miles away from home and facing up to the biggest day of his young life.Having honed his skills as a kicker, 22-year-old Smyth did enough at the NFL Combine and International Player Pathway Pro Day to make the New Orleans Saints sit up and take notice.Smyth was invited to train with the Saints and showcase his kicking skills at the Saints' training facility under the watchful eye of head coach Dennis Allen among others.He kicked well. He missed a few, but nailed one from 61 yards and was generally happy enough with how he performed under pressure.After he was done kicking, he was told to grab a shower.""I was thinking 'what's going to happen here?' - my head was absolutely scrambled,"" Smyth told The GAA Social.""I didn't know what was happening, I was like 'am I getting a contract or not here?' because they talked about working with me in the future.""Listen to Charlie Smyth on The GAA Social 'Real work starts now' - Smyth on Saints dealAfter a quick scrub, Smyth was told he was going to be taken upstairs. A good sign, he thought.He was right. Upstairs, he met the general manager Mickey Loomis and was offered a three-year contract.After going through the terms with his agent, Smyth signed and his life would never be the same again. Smyth hadn't kicked an American football before last August. Now he has a genuine shot at playing in the NFL.The last couple of weeks have been, by his own admission, ""absolutely insane"".""It's just been unbelievable. The phone has been hopping with just the support from everyone back home has been unbelievable.""I just feel very lucky and grateful.""Lucky indeed. If Smyth makes the Saints' active roster, he could earn around $800,000 (£630,680) a year. But coming from a GAA background, he's not one for getting bogged down in the big sums.Smyth knows that he's entered a cut-throat world, an environment in which his position is far from invulnerable.""They can cut you anytime [from your contract],"" he explains.""If you're on the practice squad, it's obviously different to what you'd be earning on the active roster.""It's probably about four times that amount. For me, I know I'm talking about money here, but for me it really has nothing to do with that.""Genuinely it's not, I've been a huge fan of the sport from about seven or eight years ago. For me it's all about making the best version of myself.""Smyth, who revealed he was previously a Green Bay Packers fan, added: ""At the minute, I know it might sound all serious and all, but I do have a really tough job ahead of me. I feel like I've got the confidence that I can do it.""For a young man who once excitedly slid into the DMs of the NFL UK's Instagram page asking how he could become an American footballer, Smyth seems like he has his head screwed on.He knows the road that lies ahead and the work that's required if he is to dislodge Blake Grupe - who he is yet to meet - as the Saints' kicker for the 2024 NFL season.""I've been a huge fan of the NFL. I would watch it more than Gaelic football, to be honest, and soccer as well, and it's not really normal to follow it back home,"" Smyth said.""It's maybe not something that motivates me but we probably are putting Gaelic football on the map. The number of people I've spoken to in the States who are like 'what's this Gaelic soccer, or football?'. We're creating awareness for it.""The key question, of course, is: is Smyth good enough to make it?""I feel like I am. I have a few adjustments to make but I definitely have the leg, the height on my kicks and the power and I feel like there's a few kickers who don't have that.""If I can keep developing and taking on the tips from the coaches, I feel like I can be in the better half of the kickers in the league. The standard is so high, it's unbelievable.""",767,Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/68761698
How Taylor Swift is helping flag football keep growing before Olympic debut,"Taylor Swift is proving to be American football's gift that keeps on giving.The global superstar's relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce lured scores of new fans to the USA's National Football League last season.Her presence at the Chiefs' Super Bowl win in February helped make it the most watched ever, with a record number of female viewers., externalFrom the UK to Australia, the American singer-songwriter is not just bringing new spectators to the sport, she is inspiring young girls to play it too.And that is helping one of the world's fastest growing sports - flag football - grow even faster before making its Olympic debut.After a failed attempt at inclusion for Tokyo 2020, the International Federation of American Football (Ifaf) agreed a partnership with the NFL, targeting Los Angeles 2028.In 2017 the NFL launched its own programme, external for flag football, the non-contact version of the game, and last October it was one of five sports added to the Olympic programme for 2028.""It's really special for a lot of young people, that they now can play at the pinnacle of sport and represent their country in flag football,"" former Great Britain player Afia Law, now NFL Flag's international development manager, told BBC Sport. Listen: Sportshour - How flag football became an Olympic sportFlag is the most inclusive and accessible form of American football. It is played by more than 20 million people, across more than 100 countries, and the rapid growth of the women's game was key to earning the Olympic vote.""Female participation has really been the driving force,"" said NFL analyst Phoebe Schecter, who has also played both flag and tackle football for Great Britain. ""People used to say that flag was a female sport whereas men would play tackle, but it's for everyone now. People see how explosive it is, the incredible contested catches, and it doesn't matter what your gender is, this is a place where you can just compete and have a great time.""Yet Great Britain's teams have not just been having a great time, they have been winning too. Schecter played on the women's team that became European champions last August, then helped coach the Under-17 girls as they also became European champions in September.There have been many obstacles for the current women's team. Kate Bruinvels had to set up a crowdfunding page, external to raise the £750 she needed to compete in Ireland last summer.Meanwhile, after discovering flag football at primary school, Kellie Barrett and her family formed their own club - the Coventry Cougars - so that she and her sister could keep playing.But Loughborough College now offers 10 flag football scholarships for male and female athletes aged 16-19, and the British game is set for a funding boost before the World Championships in August, for which Great Britain's women and men have qualified.""We've been successful without that help - how successful can we be with it?"" asked Britain captain Barrett.""My hope is that we're going through this hardship now, whereas any girls just starting to play won't have that barrier. They won't have to take on any financial burden.""The NFL Flag programme expanded in 2018 to the UK, where 500 schools and 30,000 players now participate in flag - 53% of them female. A girls league was also launched in London last year, expanding for its second season to 260 girls from 21 schools.And as well as going on to play for Britain, the most promising British youngsters can earn a free education through flag football, perhaps even a career.Flag is now a varsity sport in the US - for men and women - with college scholarships available for international student-athletes. A new professional men's league - the American Flag Football League, external - begins on 27 April, with a women's division set to launch in 2025.Even in Australia, many athletes are considering switching sports to flag football. One female ex-Australian Rules player has been offered a US scholarship after playing in just one international flag tournament.How did Taylor Swift's attendance influence the NFL's big game?Listen: Sportshour - Philadelphia Eagles' girls flag league and sports bra pledge""I've got two little girls, aged seven and eight, who love the game now,"" said Gridiron Australia chief executive Wade Kelly.""They love netball as well but now flag football's taking over. Taylor Swift maybe bumped that along a bit, but that's all they want to play now, down at the park or at the beach.""As a dad, to know they can go and get an education that's paid for in the US, see the world, go to the Olympics, maybe even turn pro - it's a legitimate pathway for them, and a really exciting one.""Flag football became an Olympic sport just three weeks after Taylor Swift attended her first Chiefs game.Since then, many UK flag teams such as the East Kilbride Pirates have reported a boom in awareness and interest, from newcomers and also from tackle players wanting to switch over.That isn't all down to the Taylor Swift effect, but there is no denying that it has reached far beyond the NFL arena.""People, especially young girls, are now aware of the sport in a way they never have been before,"" said East Kilbride's club chair Amanda McDonald.""It's amazing she's got people talking about it, which can only be good for the game and perhaps act as a gateway to get people involved who otherwise might not have.""For the first time, there's a pathway all the way to the podium. We're about to start a new team for the 14-17 age group and, who knows, one of them could be a future Olympian.""Get American Football alerts in the BBC Sport app",946,Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/68602507

Louis Rees-Zammit: Former Wales rugby union wing joins Kansas City Chiefs,"Former Wales rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit has joined back-to-back Super Bowl champions the Kansas City Chiefs.The 23-year-old drew interest from several NFL franchises, and also had meetings with the New York Jets, Cleveland Browns and Denver Broncos.Rees-Zammit, who was part of the 2024 international player pathway (IPP), joins the Chiefs just 10 weeks after quitting Welsh rugby on the eve of this year's Six Nations tournament.In a video posted on X, Rees-Zammit said he ""can't wait"" to see Chiefs fans at the team's Arrowhead Stadium.Join the BBC Sport WhatsApp channelsRees-Zammit signed a three-year contract with the Chiefs - typifying the faith shown in the Welshman by Andy Reid's team as IPP players aren't guaranteed any length of contract.He has also been given a guaranteed salary in addition to a signing bonus.He has targeted a hybrid role playing at both wide receiver and running back, and his next task will be to try to earn a regular-season roster spot.He was one of 16 players to take part in the 2024 IPP, a 10-week crash course designed to teach the required skills to succeed in the NFL.The ex-Gloucester player - who has won 32 caps for Wales, scoring 14 tries - showcased his skills at University of South Florida's Pro Day earlier this month, with scouts from all 32 NFL teams in attendance.While he did not test at an extremely high level in all metrics, his pace was impressive and up to the standard of NFL wide receivers.Now with the Chiefs, Rees-Zammit will be competing with the rest of the off-season squad to earn a place on Kansas City's final 53-man active roster for the 2024 season, which begins in September.If he does not make it, Rees-Zammit is likely to spend his first season on Kansas City's practice squad.What does joining NFL team mean for Rees-Zammit?Gaelic footballer Smyth gets NFL deal with New OrleansWATCH: Being Louis Rees-ZammitThis year, for the first time, all 32 NFL franchises will be given an additional place in their practice squads specifically for international players, including those who have come through the IPP.Teams who have an international player on their practice squad will also be allowed to promote them to their active roster, up to three times during the season.As well as the hybrid role Rees-Zammit has talked about wanting to play, in the short term he may have a greater chance of being utilised as a kick returner.NFL rule changes have been implemented to encourage teams to return a greater number of kick-offs, an area where the Chiefs could look to use him.He has previously said he ""would love"" to return kicks on special teams, and his size, strength, speed and agility are attributes teams look for at the position.LISTEN: NFL UK's Hodgson discusses what Chiefs can expect from Rees-ZammitGet American Football alerts in the BBC Sport appReduce stress levels and make peace with imperfections...: Escape the noise of daily life with the ultimate therapeutic podcastFrank Skinner's baffling take on online reviews: If you reviewed Ben Nevis online as 'very steep and too high', this show salutes you!",512,Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/68686340
"NFL free-agency: Kirk Cousins, Chris Jones and Derrick Henry among biggest 2024 deals","The NFL was back with a bang this week as its 32 teams started shaping their rosters for the 2024 season.Just over four weeks after the Kansas City Chiefs won their third Super Bowl in five years, the new league year officially got under way.It begins with the free agency period and this year it was a busy week, with more than 100 deals being agreed. Pittsburgh signing quarterbacks Russell Wilson and Justin Fields were the most high-profile moves but here are more of the biggest deals.Kirk Cousins has had to bide his time before becoming one of the NFL's top quarterbacks. An afterthought of a draft pick by Washington in 2012, he did not become their starter until his fourth year.After moving to Minnesota in 2018, he established himself as one of the NFL's most consistent passers, albeit more functional than flashy. Yet over the last couple of years, the seemingly strait-laced family man has also become an unlikely fans' favourite.Cousins was the star of the Quarterback series on Netflix, which followed him, Patrick Mahomes and Marcus Mariota during the 2022 season. And after a big away win, Cousins celebrated by going shirtless on the Vikings' flight home, dancing while covered in bling.Injury ended his 2023 season but the 35-year-old has now been lured to Atlanta with the biggest contract of his career - a four-year deal worth $180m (£141m). He will lead a vibrant young offence while last year's starter Desmond Ridder is heading to Arizona.While Patrick Mahomes again produced when it matters most for Kansas City, last season's Super Bowl run was actually built on the Chiefs' defence.Chris Jones is its leader, playing throughout the team's dynasty, and they recognised his importance by handing the 29-year-old a record deal for a defensive tackle - $158.75m (£124.7m) over five years.Rams defensive star Aaron Donald announces retirementAfter their Super Bowl epic in 2023, Philadelphia were on course for a rematch with Kansas City before suffering a late-season slump.Veteran centre Jason Kelce then retired but the Eagles have given themselves a boost by adding one of the NFL's best running backs to a team that already tends to have one of the league's best offensive lines and running games.Nicknamed 'Saquad' for the size of his thighs, Barkley was 2018's Offensive Rookie of the Year and has shown signs of getting back to his best over the last couple of seasons.He's been one of the Giants' few playmakers over the last six years so it was a surprise they let him go when he's still only 27. Barkley joins their divisional rivals on a three-year, $37.8m deal, while D'Andre Swift has left Philly for Chicago.""I'm pretty positive, even though a little bit upset [the Eagles] waited until I retired to make a move like this,"" Kelce said on his podcast. ""I knew I was going to miss an outstanding season for the Eagles, but I get to watch it and celebrate it just like everybody else, so I'm excited for that.""A battering ram of a running back, Derrick Henry has been the NFL's best since coming into the league in 2016, being named 2020's Offensive Player of the Year.But Tennessee are in the midst of a rebuild and running backs are thought to be in decline once they turn 30, as Henry did in January. Baltimore, though, felt the opportunity to sign a player who has been such a dominant force was too good to pass up.""He's kind of a unicorn,"" said Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta. ""It's a combination of speed, power, durability. Those kind of guys are rare.""Henry joins a team that had the NFL's best record in the regular season and will allow mobile quarterback Lamar Jackson, named Most Valuable Player for a second time, to save his legs for when he really needs to conjure some magic.After arriving on a two-year, $16m contract, Henry had a clear message for his doubters: ""Tell them to keep watching"".That Tennessee rebuild has seen the Titans sign running back Tony Pollard from Dallas to replace Henry, while adding quarterback Mason Rudolph from Pittsburgh.But their biggest deal was bringing in wide receiver Calvin Ridley, 29, from Jacksonville on a four-year, $92 contract.Another team in a rebuild is Washington and they have added a defensive leader in 33-year-old linebacker Bobby Wagner, who led the league for tackles last season.They brought in quarterback Marcus Mariota so let last season's starter Sam Howell join Seattle, and are expected to draft another QB with the second overall pick. They have also added pedigree to their offence with running back Austin Ekeler and tight end Zach Ertz.After playing for three teams in a year, Tampa Bay gave Baker Mayfield, 28, a chance to revive his career last season and he took advantage by leading them to the play-offs.They have rewarded 2018's number one draft pick with a three-year contract worth $100m and re-signed star receiver Mike Evans too.Las Vegas have bolstered their hard-nosed defence by signing tackle Christian Wilkins on a four-year, $110m deal. They have also brought in quarterback Gardner Minshew from Indianapolis so let Jimmy Garoppolo join the Los Angeles Rams.The Green Bay Packers made a surprise move by signing Josh Jacobs from the Raiders and letting fellow running back Aaron Jones join divisional rivals Minnesota, who have also brought in quarterback Sam Darnold from San Francisco to help replace Kirk Cousins.Last season showed the value in having reliable cover at quarterback, with more than 60 used as starters due to inconsistent form and injuries. Teams have been shuffling their pack before the draft (25-27 April), bringing in guys to compete for the starters' job or serve as back-ups, with some of those mentioned above involved in a quarterback merry-go-round.Other notable names on the move are Jameis Winston to Cleveland, Joe Flacco to Indianapolis, Jacoby Brissett to New England, Mac Jones to Jacksonville, Drew Lock to the Giants and Tyrod Taylor to the Jets.Get American Football alerts in the BBC Sport app",997,Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/68572226
Charlie Smyth: Gaelic footballer gets NFL deal with New Orleans Saints,"Down GAA goalkeeper Charlie Smyth has signed for the NFL's New Orleans Saints on a three-year contract.The 22-year-old will have the chance to fulfil his American football dream with the 2010 Super Bowl champions.Smyth joins the Saints as a kicker after impressing at trials and will aim to make the active roster.The Mayobridge goalkeeper has made his eye-catching move through the NFL's international player pathway (IPP) programme.New Orleans confirmed the deal for Smyth on Friday, as he swaps Gaelic football for American football.Tadhg Leader, who is a kicking coach for the IPP and was integral in bringing Smyth into the pathway programme, said he was ""lost for words"".""I first met Charlie 6 months ago,"" Leader posted on X., external""He and his family put their trust in me.

That showing led to interest from the Saints.Although he has now joined the Louisiana franchise, Smyth is not guaranteed time on the field.Over the summer he has the opportunity to compete with last season's kicker Blake Grupe.NFL franchises can have 90 players on their roster throughout the off-season and that number is cut to 53 right before the start of the regular season, which will be the team's active roster.Those who miss out are either released or retained on the practice squad, where players can still earn sizeable salaries and be promoted to the active roster during the course of the season.From the 2024 season, which begins in September, all 32 NFL teams can have an additional spot on their practice squad for international players, including those who have come through the IPP, which aims to discover new talent and expand American football's global reach.Wales rugby union star Louis Rees-Zammit, who has signed with Super Bowl champions the Kansas City Chiefs, is another high-profile name from this year's IPP programme.In January, Green Bay Packers punter Dan Whelan became the first Irish-born player to play in the NFL playoffs for 41 years.",503,Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/68661901

Pittsburgh Steelers sign quarterback Russell Wilson then agree Kenny Pickett trade,"The Pittsburgh Steelers have signed former Super Bowl-winning quarterback Russell Wilson on a one-year contract.The 35-year-old was a free agent as the Denver Broncos released him just two years after signing him in one of the most valuable trades in NFL history.The Steelers then agreed to trade Kenny Pickett to the Philadelphia Eagles.""I was fortunate to have several teams call, but this is where I wanted to be,"" said Wilson of Pittsburgh, who have won a joint-record six NFL titles.""To be a Pittsburgh Steeler, to wear the black and gold - it's a true honour. The tradition, the history. There's six [Super Bowl] trophies in there. We've got to go get a seventh.""In a 10-year stint with the Seattle Seahawks, Wilson won the Super Bowl against Denver in 2014 and is one of just five active QBs to have started and won the NFL's championship game, the others being Patrick Mahomes, Matthew Stafford, Aaron Rodgers and Joe Flacco.Denver traded two first-round draft picks, two second-round picks, a fifth-round pick and three players to Seattle in exchange for Wilson and a fourth-round pick before the start of the 2022 season.

He did improve with Payton in his second year but it's not the same old Russell Wilson.They brought Payton in and, truthfully, he never really wanted Wilson. He wanted to find his players to bring in, so I think that was the biggest issue there.This is almost a 'no-brainer' for the Steelers, paying that little money for a starting quarterback, for a veteran, who was in the league last year.",466,Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/68532388
