Atrial fibrillation,"In a typical heart, a tiny group of cells at the sinus node sends out an electrical signal. The signal travels through the heart's upper chambers to the atrioventricular (AV) node. The signal then passes into the lower heart chambers, causing them to squeeze and pump out blood. In atrial fibrillation, electrical signals fire from many locations in the upper chambers, causing them to beat chaotically. Since the AV node doesn't prevent all of these chaotic signals from entering the lower chambers, the heart beats faster and irregularly.In a typical heart, a tiny group of cells at the sinus node sends out an electrical signal. The signal travels through the heart's upper chambers to the atrioventricular (AV) node. The signal then passes into the lower heart chambers, causing them to squeeze and pump out blood. In atrial fibrillation, electrical signals fire from many locations in the upper chambers, causing them to beat chaotically. Since the AV node doesn't prevent all of these chaotic signals from entering the lower chambers, the heart beats faster and irregularly.Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm. An irregular heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia. AFib can lead to blood clots in the heart. The condition also increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers  called the atria  beat chaotically and irregularly. They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. For many people, AFib may have no symptoms. But AFib may cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness.Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent. AFib itself usually isn't life-threatening. But it's a serious medical condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke.Treatment for atrial fibrillation may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals.A person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm problem called atrial flutter. The treatments for AFib and atrial flutter are similar.Symptoms of AFib may include:Some people with atrial fibrillation (AFib) don't notice any symptoms.Atrial fibrillation may be:If you have symptoms of atrial fibrillation, make an appointment for a health checkup. You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist.If you have chest pain, seek immediate medical help.

The sinus node makes the signals that starts each heartbeat.The signals move across the upper heart chambers. Next, the signals arrive at a group of cells called the AV node, where they usually slow down. The signals then go to the lower heart chambers.In a healthy heart, this signaling process usually goes smoothly. The resting heart rate is typically 60 to 100 beats a minute.But in atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic. As a result, the upper chambers tremble or shake. The AV node is flooded with signals trying to get through to the lower heart chambers. This causes a fast and irregular heart rhythm.In people with AFib, the heart rate may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute.Problems with the heart's structure are the most common cause of atrial fibrillation (AFib).Heart diseases and health problems that can cause AFib include:Heart surgery or stress due to surgery or sickness may also cause AFib. Some people who have atrial fibrillation have no known heart disease or heart damage.Lifestyle habits that can trigger an AFib episode may include:Things that can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation (AFib) include:Blood clots are a dangerous complication of atrial fibrillation (AFib). Blood clots can lead to stroke.The risk of stroke from AFib increases as you grow older. Other health conditions also may increase the risk of a stroke due to AFib. These conditions include:Blood thinners are commonly prescribed to prevent blood clots and strokes in people with atrial fibrillation.Healthy lifestyle choices can reduce the risk of heart disease and may prevent atrial fibrillation (AFib).

Abdominal aortic aneurysm,"An abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs when a lower part of the body's main artery, called the aorta, becomes weakened and bulges.An abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs when a lower part of the body's main artery, called the aorta, becomes weakened and bulges.An abdominal aortic aneurysm is an enlarged area in the lower part of the body's main artery, called the aorta. The aorta runs from the heart through the center of the chest and belly area, called the abdomen.The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. An abdominal aortic aneurysm that ruptures can cause life-threatening bleeding.Treatment depends on the size of the aneurysm and how fast it's growing. Treatment varies from regular health checkups and imaging tests to emergency surgery.Abdominal aortic aneurysms often grow slowly without noticeable symptoms. This makes them difficult to detect. Some aneurysms never rupture. Many start small and stay small. Others grow larger over time, sometimes quickly.If you have a growing abdominal aortic aneurysm, you might notice:If you have pain, especially if pain is sudden and severe, seek medical help right away.There is a problem with

Most aortic aneurysms occur in the part of the aorta that's in the belly area, called the abdomen. Several things can lead to the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, including:Abdominal aortic aneurysm risk factors include:If you're at risk of an aortic aneurysm, medicines may be given to lower your blood pressure and relieve stress on weakened arteries.Complications of abdominal aortic aneurysms include:A rupture can cause life-threatening internal bleeding. In general, the larger the aneurysm and the faster it grows, the greater the risk of rupture.Symptoms that an aortic aneurysm has ruptured can include:Aortic aneurysms also increase the risk of developing blood clots in the area. If a blood clot breaks loose from the inside wall of an aneurysm, it can block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body. Symptoms of a blocked blood vessel may include pain or reduced blood flow to the legs, toes, kidneys or belly area.To prevent an abdominal aortic aneurysm or to keep one from worsening, do the following:

Hyperhidrosis,"Hyperhidrosis (hi-pur-hi-DROE-sis) is excessive sweating that's not always related to heat or exercise. You may sweat so much that it soaks through your clothes or drips off your hands. Heavy sweating can disrupt your day and cause social anxiety and embarrassment.Hyperhidrosis treatment usually helps. It often begins with antiperspirants. If these don't help, you may need to try different medications and therapies. In severe cases, your health care provider may suggest surgery to remove the sweat glands or to disconnect the nerves related to producing too much sweat.Sometimes an underlying condition may be found and treated.The main symptom of hyperhidrosis is heavy sweating. This goes beyond the sweating from being in a hot environment, exercising, or feeling anxious or stressed. The type of hyperhidrosis that usually affects the hands, feet, underarms or face causes at least one episode a week when you're awake. And the sweating usually happens on both sides of the body.Sometimes excessive sweating is a sign of a serious condition.Seek immediate medical attention if you have heavy sweating with dizziness, pain in the chest, throat, jaw, arms, shoulders or throat, or cold skin and a rapid pulse.See your health care provider if:There is a problem with

Achalasia,"Achalasia is a rare disorder that makes it difficult for food and liquid to pass from the swallowing tube connecting your mouth and stomach (esophagus) into your stomach.Achalasia occurs when nerves in the esophagus become damaged. As a result, the esophagus becomes paralyzed and dilated over time and eventually loses the ability to squeeze food down into the stomach. Food then collects in the esophagus, sometimes fermenting and washing back up into the mouth, which can taste bitter. Some people mistake this for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, in achalasia the food is coming from the esophagus, whereas in GERD the material comes from the stomach.There's no cure for achalasia. Once the esophagus is paralyzed, the muscle cannot work properly again. But symptoms can usually be managed with endoscopy, minimally invasive therapy or surgery.Achalasia symptoms generally appear gradually and worsen over time. Signs and symptoms may include:There is a problem with

You rely on it virtually every time you walk and move your foot.Rupture usually occurs in the section of the tendon situated within 2 1/2 inches (about 6 centimeters) of the point where it attaches to the heel bone. This section might be prone to rupture because blood flow is poor, which also can impair its ability to heal.Ruptures often are caused by a sudden increase in the stress on your Achilles tendon. Common examples include:Factors that may increase your risk of Achilles tendon rupture include:Your Achilles tendon connects the muscles in the back of your leg to your heel bone. The calf stretch exercise can help prevent an Achilles tendon rupture. To do the stretch, follow these steps: 1. Stand at arm's length from a wall or a sturdy piece of exercise equipment. Put your palms flat against the wall or hold on to the piece of equipment. 2. Keep one leg back with your knee straight and your heel flat on the floor. 3. Slowly bend your elbows and front knee and move your hips forward until you feel a stretch in your calf. 4. Hold this position for 30 to 60 seconds. 5.

This muscle is called the lower esophageal sphincter.Infant reflux is when a baby spits up liquid or food. It happens when stomach contents move back up from a baby's stomach into the esophagus. The esophagus is the muscular tube that connects the mouth to the stomach.Reflux happens in healthy infants many times a day. As long as your baby is healthy, content and growing well, reflux is not a cause for concern. Sometimes called gastroesophageal reflux (GER), the condition becomes less common as a baby gets older. It's unusual for infant reflux to continue after age 18 months.In rare cases, infant reflux leads to weight loss or growth that lags behind other children of the same age and sex. These symptoms may indicate a medical problem. These medical problems may include an allergy, a blockage in the digestive system or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a more serious form of GER that causes serious health issues.In most cases, infant reflux isn't a cause for concern.

This muscle is called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). When the LES is not fully developed, it allows stomach contents to flow back up into the esophagus. Over time, the LES typically matures. It opens when your baby swallows and remains tightly closed at other times, keeping stomach contents where they belong.Some factors that contribute to infant reflux are common in babies and often can't be avoided. These include lying flat most of the time and being fed an almost completely liquid diet.Sometimes, infant reflux can be caused by more-serious conditions, such as:Infant reflux is common. But some things make it more likely that a baby will experience infant reflux. These include:Infant reflux usually resolves on its own. It rarely causes problems for babies.If your baby has a more serious condition such as GERD, your baby's growth may lag behind that of other children. Some research indicates that babies who have frequent episodes of spitting up might be more likely to develop GERD later in childhood.

The ACL connects the thighbone (femur) to the shinbone (tibia). It's most commonly torn during sports that involve sudden stops and changes in direction  such as basketball, soccer, tennis and volleyball.An ACL injury is a tear or sprain of the anterior cruciate (KROO-she-ate) ligament (ACL)  one of the strong bands of tissue that help connect your thigh bone (femur) to your shinbone (tibia). ACL injuries most commonly occur during sports that involve sudden stops or changes in direction, jumping and landing  such as soccer, basketball, football and downhill skiing.Many people hear a pop or feel a ""popping"" sensation in the knee when an ACL injury occurs. Your knee may swell, feel unstable and become too painful to bear weight.Depending on the severity of your ACL injury, treatment may include rest and rehabilitation exercises to help you regain strength and stability, or surgery to replace the torn ligament followed by rehabilitation. A proper training program may help reduce the risk of an ACL injury.Signs and symptoms of an ACL injury usually include:Seek immediate care if any injury to your knee causes signs or symptoms of an ACL injury.

The ACL, one of two ligaments that cross in the middle of the knee, connects your thighbone to your shinbone and helps stabilize your knee joint.ACL injuries often happen during sports and fitness activities that can put stress on the knee:When the ligament is damaged, there is usually a partial or complete tear of the tissue. A mild injury may stretch the ligament but leave it intact.There are a number of factors that increase your risk of an ACL injury, including:People who experience an ACL injury have a higher risk of developing osteoarthritis in the knee. Arthritis may occur even if you have surgery to reconstruct the ligament.Multiple factors likely influence the risk of arthritis, such as the severity of the original injury, the presence of related injuries in the knee joint or the level of activity after treatment.Proper training and exercise can help reduce the risk of ACL injury. A sports medicine physician, physical therapist, athletic trainer or other specialist in sports medicine can provide assessment, instruction and feedback that can help you reduce risks.Programs to reduce ACL injury include:Training to strengthen muscles of the legs, hips and core  as well as training to improve jumping and landing techniques and to prevent inward movement of the knee  may help to reduce the higher ACL injury risk in female athletes.Wear footwear and padding that is appropriate for your sport to help prevent injury. If you downhill ski, make sure your ski bindings are adjusted correctly by a trained professional so that your skis will release appropriately if you fall.Wearing a knee brace doesn't appear to prevent ACL injury or reduce the risk of recurring injury after surgery.

Acne,"Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages.Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and bumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up.Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.Cystic acne  the most severe form of acne  occurs when oil and dead skin cells build up deep within hair follicles. The resulting rupture within your skin may form boil-like inflammation.Cystic acne  the most severe form of acne  occurs when oil and dead skin cells build up deep within hair follicles. The resulting rupture within your skin may form boil-like inflammation.Acne signs vary depending on the severity of your condition:Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders.If self-care remedies don't clear your acne, see your primary care doctor. He or she can prescribe stronger medications. If acne persists or is severe, you may want to seek medical treatment from a doctor who specializes in the skin (dermatologist or pediatric dermatologist).For many women, acne can persist for decades, with flares common a week before menstruation. This type of acne tends to clear up without treatment in women who use contraceptives.In older adults, a sudden onset of severe acne may signal an underlying disease requiring medical attention.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that some popular nonprescription acne lotions, cleansers and other skin products can cause a serious reaction. This type of reaction is quite rare, so don't confuse it with any redness, irritation or itchiness that occurs in areas where you've applied medications or products.Seek emergency medical help if after using a skin product you experience:There is a problem with

Bacteria can trigger inflammation and infection resulting in more severe acne.Four main factors cause acne:Acne typically appears on your face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders because these areas of skin have the most oil (sebaceous) glands. Hair follicles are connected to oil glands.The follicle wall may bulge and produce a whitehead. Or the plug may be open to the surface and darken, causing a blackhead. A blackhead may look like dirt stuck in pores. But actually the pore is congested with bacteria and oil, which turns brown when it's exposed to the air.Pimples are raised red spots with a white center that develop when blocked hair follicles become inflamed or infected with bacteria. Blockages and inflammation deep inside hair follicles produce cystlike lumps beneath the surface of your skin.

It often occurs in the armpits.Hidradenitis suppurativa (hi-drad-uh-NIE-tis sup-yoo-ruh-TIE-vuh), also known as acne inversa, is a condition that causes small, painful lumps to form under the skin. The lumps usually develop in areas where your skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts. The lumps heal slowly, recur, and can lead to tunnels under the skin and scarring.Hidradenitis suppurativa tends to start after puberty, usually before age 40. It can persist for many years and worsen over time. It can affect your daily life and emotional well-being. Combined medical and surgical therapy can help manage the disease and prevent complications.Women are three times more likely to develop hidradenitis suppurativa, though this ratio can differ by location around the world. Also, Black people are more likely to develop this disease than people of other races. This could be attributed to genetic factors.Hidradenitis suppurativa can affect one or several areas of the body. Signs and symptoms of the condition include:Some people with this condition experience only mild symptoms. The course of the disease is highly variable. Excess weight and being a smoker are associated with worse symptoms, but people who are thin and don't smoke can experience severe disease.Early diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa is key to effective treatment. See your dermatologist if your condition:Your dermatologist can create a treatment plan for you.Hidradenitis suppurativa is not just a boil, and many people with this condition also have related conditions.

Acoustic neuroma,"An acoustic neuroma, also known as a vestibular schwannoma, is a noncancerous tumor. It develops on the balance nerve, known as the vestibular nerve, and on the auditory nerve, known as the cochlear nerve. These nerves lead from your inner ear to the brain, as shown in the top image. The pressure on the nerve from the tumor may cause hearing loss and imbalance. In some cases, the tumor may grow and affect the cerebellum or other brain tissues, as shown in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and illustrations above.An acoustic neuroma, also known as a vestibular schwannoma, is a noncancerous tumor.

The pressure on the nerve from the tumor may cause hearing loss and imbalance. In some cases, the tumor may grow and affect the cerebellum or other brain tissues, as shown in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and illustrations above.An acoustic neuroma is a noncancerous tumor that develops on the main nerve leading from the inner ear to the brain. This nerve is called the vestibular nerve. Branches of the nerve directly affect balance and hearing. Pressure from an acoustic neuroma can cause hearing loss, ringing in the ear and problems with balance. Another name for an acoustic neuroma is vestibular schwannoma.An acoustic neuroma develops from the Schwann cells covering the vestibular nerve. An acoustic neuroma is usually slow-growing. Rarely, it may grow quickly and become large enough to press against the brain and affect vital functions.Treatments for an acoustic neuroma include monitoring, radiation and surgical removal.Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are often easy to miss and may take years to develop. Symptoms may occur because of the tumor's effects on the hearing and balance nerves. The tumor also can put pressure on nearby nerves controlling facial muscles, known as the facial nerve, and sensation, known as the trigeminal nerve. Blood vessels or brain structures also can be affected by an acoustic neuroma.As the tumor grows, it may be more likely to cause more noticeable or worse symptoms.Common symptoms of an acoustic neuroma include:Rarely, an acoustic neuroma may grow large enough to compress the brainstem and become life-threatening.See a health care professional if you notice hearing loss in one ear, ringing in your ear or balance problems.Early diagnosis of an acoustic neuroma may help keep the tumor from growing large enough to cause complications such as total hearing loss.There is a problem with

Typically, this gene produces a tumor suppressor protein that helps control the growth of Schwann cells covering the nerves.Experts don't know what causes this problem with the gene. Often there is no known cause for an acoustic neuroma. This gene change is inherited in people with a rare disorder called neurofibromatosis type 2. People with neurofibromatosis type 2 usually have growth of tumors on the hearing and balance nerves on both sides of the head. These tumors are known as bilateral vestibular schwannomas.In an autosomal dominant disorder, the changed gene is a dominant gene. It's located on one of the nonsex chromosomes, called autosomes. Only one changed gene is needed to be affected by this type of condition. A person with an autosomal dominant condition  in this example, the father  has a 50% chance of having an affected child with one changed gene. The person has a 50% chance of having an unaffected child.In an autosomal dominant disorder, the changed gene is a dominant gene. It's located on one of the nonsex chromosomes, called autosomes.

The person has a 50% chance of having an unaffected child.The only confirmed risk factor for acoustic neuromas is having a parent with the rare genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 2. However, neurofibromatosis type 2 only accounts for about 5% of acoustic neuroma cases.A hallmark characteristic of neurofibromatosis type 2 is noncancerous tumors on the balance nerves on both sides of the head. Tumors also may develop on other nerves.Neurofibromatosis type 2 is known as an autosomal dominant disorder. This means that the gene related to the disorder can be passed to a child by just one parent. Each child of an affected parent has a 50-50 chance of inheriting it.An acoustic neuroma may cause permanent complications, including:Large tumors may press on the brainstem, occasionally preventing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid between the brain and spinal cord. Fluid can build up in your head, a condition known as hydrocephalus. This increases the pressure inside the skull.

HIV/AIDS,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is an ongoing, also called chronic, condition. It's caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, also called HIV. HIV damages the immune system so that the body is less able to fight infection and disease. If HIV isn't treated, it can take years before it weakens the immune system enough to become AIDS. Thanks to treatment, most people in the U.S. don't get AIDS.HIV is spread through contact with genitals, such as during sex without a condom. This type of infection is called a sexually transmitted infection, also called an STI. HIV also is spread through contact with blood, such as when people share needles or syringes. It is also possible for a person with untreated HIV to spread the virus to a child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.There's no cure for HIV/AIDS. But medicines can control the infection and keep the disease from getting worse. Antiviral treatments for HIV have reduced AIDS deaths around the world. There's an ongoing effort to make ways to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS more available in resource-poor countries.The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary depending on the person and the phase of infection.Some people infected by HIV get a flu-like illness within 2 to 4 weeks after the virus enters the body. This stage may last a few days to several weeks. Some people have no symptoms during this stage.Possible symptoms include:These symptoms can be so mild that you might not notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream, called viral load, is high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads to others more easily during primary infection than during the next stage.In this stage of infection, HIV is still in the body and cells of the immune system, called white blood cells. But during this time, many people don't have symptoms or the infections that HIV can cause.This stage can last for many years for people who aren't getting antiretroviral therapy, also called ART. Some people get more-severe disease much sooner.As the virus continues to multiply and destroy immune cells, you may get mild infections or long-term symptoms such as:Better antiviral treatments have greatly decreased deaths from AIDS worldwide. Thanks to these lifesaving treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don't get AIDS. Untreated, HIV most often turns into AIDS in about 8 to 10 years.Having AIDS means your immune system is very damaged. People with AIDS are more likely to develop diseases they wouldn't get if they had healthy immune systems. These are called opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers. Some people get opportunistic infections during the acute stage of the disease.The symptoms of some of these infections may include:If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a healthcare professional as soon as you can.There is a problem with

It can spread through sexual contact, shooting of illicit drugs or use of shared needles, and contact with infected blood. It also can spread from parent to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.HIV destroys white blood cells called CD4 T cells. These cells play a large role in helping the body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes.You can have an HIV infection with few or no symptoms for years before it turns into AIDS. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 T cell count falls below 200 or you have a complication you get only if you have AIDS, such as a serious infection or cancer.You can get infected with HIV if infected blood, semen or fluids from a vagina enter your body. This can happen when you:You can't become infected with HIV through casual contact. That means you can't catch HIV or get AIDS by hugging, kissing, dancing or shaking hands with someone who has the infection.HIV isn't spread through air, water or insect bites. You can't get HIV by donating blood.Anyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can have HIV/AIDS. However, you're at greatest risk of HIV/AIDS if you:HIV  infection weakens your immune system. The infection makes you much more likely to get many infections and certain types of cancers.Toxoplasmosis. This infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats. Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools. The parasites then can spread to other animals and humans.Toxoplasmosis can cause heart disease. Seizures happen when it spreads to the brain. And it can be fatal.There's no vaccine to prevent HIV infection and no cure for HIV/AIDS. But you can protect yourself and others from infection.To help prevent the spread of HIV:Consider preexposure prophylaxis, also called PrEP. There are two PrEP medicines taken by mouth, also called oral, and one PrEP medicine given in the form of a shot, called injectable. The oral medicines are emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy). The injectable medicine is called cabotegravir (Apretude). PrEP can reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection in people at very high risk.PrEP can reduce the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% and from injecting drugs by at least 74%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Descovy hasn't been studied in people who have sex by having a penis put into their vaginas, called receptive vaginal sex.Cabotegravir (Apretude) is the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved PrEP that can be given as a shot to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection in people at very high risk. A healthcare professional gives the shot. After two once-monthly shots, Apretude is given every two months. The shot is an option in place of a daily PrEP pill.Your healthcare professional prescribes these medicines to prevent HIV only to people who don't already have HIV infection. You need an HIV test before you start taking any PrEP. You need to take the test every three months for the pills or before each shot for as long as you take PrEP.You need to take the pills every day or closely follow the shot schedule. You still need to practice safe sex to protect against other STIs. If you have hepatitis B, you should see an infectious disease or liver specialist before beginning PrEP therapy.Use treatment as prevention, also called TasP. If you have HIV, taking HIV medicines can keep your partner from getting infected with the virus. If your blood tests show no virus, that means your viral load can't be detected. Then you won't transmit the virus to anyone else through sex.If you use TasP, you must take your medicines exactly as prescribed and get regular checkups.Use a new condom every time you have anal or vaginal sex. Both male and female condoms are available. If you use a lubricant, make sure it's water based. Oil-based lubricants can weaken condoms and cause them to break.During oral sex, use a cut-open condom or a piece of medical-grade latex called a dental dam without a lubricant.

Acute coronary syndrome,"Acute coronary syndrome is a term that describes a range of conditions related to sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart. These conditions include a heart attack and unstable angina.A heart attack happens when cell death damages or destroys heart tissue. A heart attack also is known as a myocardial infarction.Unstable angina occurs when blood flow to the heart decreases. It's not severe enough to cause cell death or a heart attack. But the reduced blood flow may increase your risk of a heart attack.Acute coronary syndrome often causes severe chest pain or discomfort. It is a medical emergency that needs a diagnosis and care right away. The goals of treatment include improving blood flow, treating complications and preventing future problems.The symptoms of acute coronary syndrome usually begin suddenly. They include:Chest pain or discomfort is the most common symptom. But symptoms may vary quite a bit depending on your age, sex and other medical conditions. You're more likely to have symptoms without chest pain or discomfort if you're a woman, an older adult or have diabetes.Acute coronary syndrome is a medical emergency. Chest pain or discomfort can be a symptom of many life-threatening conditions. Get emergency help for a diagnosis and appropriate care right away. Do not drive yourself to the hospital.Acute coronary syndrome usually results from the buildup of fatty deposits on the walls of blood vessels that deliver blood, oxygen and nutrients to heart muscles. Fatty deposits also are called plaque. The blood vessels that supply the heart also are known as coronary arteries.When a fatty deposit ruptures or splits, a blood clot forms. This clot blocks the flow of blood to heart muscles.When the supply of oxygen to cells is too low, cells in the heart muscles can die. The death of cells results in damage to muscle tissues. This is called a heart attack.Even when there is no cell death, the drop in oxygen still results in heart muscles that don't work the way they should. This change may be short-lived or permanent. When acute coronary syndrome doesn't result in cell death, it is called unstable angina.The risk factors for acute coronary syndrome are the same as those for other types of heart disease. Risk factors include:

Acute myelogenous leukemia,"Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow  the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made.The word ""acute"" in acute myelogenous leukemia denotes the disease's rapid progression. It's called myelogenous (my-uh-LOHJ-uh-nus) leukemia because it affects a group of white blood cells called the myeloid cells, which normally develop into the various types of mature blood cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.Acute myelogenous leukemia is also known as acute myeloid leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.General signs and symptoms of the early stages of acute myelogenous leukemia may mimic those of the flu or other common diseases.Signs and symptoms of acute myelogenous leukemia include:Make an appointment with a doctor if you develop any signs or symptoms that seem unusual or that worry you.Acute myelogenous leukemia occurs when a bone marrow cell develops changes (mutations) in its genetic material or DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. Normally, the DNA tells the cell to grow at a set rate and to die at a set time. In acute myelogenous leukemia, the mutations tell the bone marrow cell to continue growing and dividing.When this happens, blood cell production becomes out of control. The bone marrow produces immature cells that develop into leukemic white blood cells called myeloblasts. These abnormal cells are unable to function properly, and they can build up and crowd out healthy cells.It's not clear what causes the DNA mutations that lead to leukemia, but doctors have identified factors that increase the risk.Factors that may increase your risk of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) include:Many people with AML have no known risk factors, and many people who have risk factors never develop the cancer.

Weakness and tingling in your hands and feet are usually the first symptoms.These sensations can quickly spread, eventually paralyzing your whole body. In its most severe form Guillain-Barre syndrome is a medical emergency. Most people with the condition must be hospitalized to receive treatment.The exact cause of Guillain-Barre syndrome is unknown. But two-thirds of patients report symptoms of an infection in the six weeks preceding. These include a COVID-19, respiratory or a gastrointestinal infection or Zika virus.There's no known cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome, but several treatments can ease symptoms and reduce the duration of the illness. Although most people recover completely from Guillain-Barre syndrome, some severe cases can be fatal. While recovery may take up to several years, most people are able to walk again six months after symptoms first started. Some people may have lasting effects from it, such as weakness, numbness or fatigue.Guillain-Barre syndrome often begins with tingling and weakness starting in your feet and legs and spreading to your upper body and arms. Some people notice the first symptoms in the arms or face. As Guillain-Barre syndrome progresses, muscle weakness can turn into paralysis.Signs and symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome may include:People with Guillain-Barre syndrome usually experience their most significant weakness within two weeks after symptoms begin.Guillain-Barre syndrome has several forms. The main types are:Call your doctor or health care provider if you have mild tingling in your toes or fingers that doesn't seem to be spreading or getting worse. Seek emergency medical help if you have any of these severe signs or symptoms:Guillain-Barre syndrome is a serious condition that requires immediate hospitalization because it can worsen rapidly.

It's also a rare reaction in those who receive the Johnson & Johnson or AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.In Guillain-Barre syndrome, your immune system  which usually attacks only invading organisms  begins attacking the nerves. In AIDP, the nerves' protective covering (myelin sheath) is damaged.

Louis Rees-Zammit: Former Wales rugby star keen to prove worth in 'cut-throat' NFL,"Louis Rees-Zammit says he is ready to show everyone what he can do to avoid being axed by Kansas City Chiefs in the ""cut-throat"" NFL.The former Wales rugby wing, 23, joined the reigning Super Bowl champions on a three-year contract in late March.He is now bidding to earn a place in the Chiefs' 53-man roster for the upcoming season.""You can get cut at any point so it's a bit of a cut-throat sport,"" Rees-Zammit told The Rugby Pod.""I could go to pre-season now, not do well and just get cut straight away.""Rees-Zammit will earn £634,000 if selected in the Chiefs' roster for the season ahead compared to £199,500 if he is in the team's practice squad.""As a rookie you sign a three-year deal and you get guaranteed money,"" he added.""So if you get injured or you get cut, you're still guaranteed that money.""You're not guaranteed the three years at all - and no-one is.""I just need to make the 53-man squad now.

NFL: Charlie Smyth wants to shine on world stage after earning New Orleans Saints deal,"Charlie Smyth's head was all over the place.This was his big opportunity and the wait to find out if his dream had been realised or shattered was proving torturous.Life has moved really fast for Smyth over the past year. Hailing from the village of Mayobridge, Smyth was at one stage training to be a teacher and playing a bit of Gaelic football, the sport he has played all his life.But after deciding to pursue his dream of becoming an American footballer, Smyth found himself in New Orleans, 4,000 miles away from home and facing up to the biggest day of his young life.Having honed his skills as a kicker, 22-year-old Smyth did enough at the NFL Combine and International Player Pathway Pro Day to make the New Orleans Saints sit up and take notice.Smyth was invited to train with the Saints and showcase his kicking skills at the Saints' training facility under the watchful eye of head coach Dennis Allen among others.He kicked well. He missed a few, but nailed one from 61 yards and was generally happy enough with how he performed under pressure.After he was done kicking, he was told to grab a shower.""I was thinking 'what's going to happen here?' - my head was absolutely scrambled,"" Smyth told The GAA Social.""I didn't know what was happening, I was like 'am I getting a contract or not here?' because they talked about working with me in the future.""Listen to Charlie Smyth on The GAA Social 'Real work starts now' - Smyth on Saints dealAfter a quick scrub, Smyth was told he was going to be taken upstairs. A good sign, he thought.He was right. Upstairs, he met the general manager Mickey Loomis and was offered a three-year contract.After going through the terms with his agent, Smyth signed and his life would never be the same again. Smyth hadn't kicked an American football before last August. Now he has a genuine shot at playing in the NFL.The last couple of weeks have been, by his own admission, ""absolutely insane"".""It's just been unbelievable. The phone has been hopping with just the support from everyone back home has been unbelievable.""I just feel very lucky and grateful.""Lucky indeed. If Smyth makes the Saints' active roster, he could earn around $800,000 (£630,680) a year. But coming from a GAA background, he's not one for getting bogged down in the big sums.Smyth knows that he's entered a cut-throat world, an environment in which his position is far from invulnerable.""They can cut you anytime [from your contract],"" he explains.""If you're on the practice squad, it's obviously different to what you'd be earning on the active roster.""It's probably about four times that amount. For me, I know I'm talking about money here, but for me it really has nothing to do with that.""Genuinely it's not, I've been a huge fan of the sport from about seven or eight years ago. For me it's all about making the best version of myself.""Smyth, who revealed he was previously a Green Bay Packers fan, added: ""At the minute, I know it might sound all serious and all, but I do have a really tough job ahead of me. I feel like I've got the confidence that I can do it.""For a young man who once excitedly slid into the DMs of the NFL UK's Instagram page asking how he could become an American footballer, Smyth seems like he has his head screwed on.He knows the road that lies ahead and the work that's required if he is to dislodge Blake Grupe - who he is yet to meet - as the Saints' kicker for the 2024 NFL season.""I've been a huge fan of the NFL. I would watch it more than Gaelic football, to be honest, and soccer as well, and it's not really normal to follow it back home,"" Smyth said.""It's maybe not something that motivates me but we probably are putting Gaelic football on the map. The number of people I've spoken to in the States who are like 'what's this Gaelic soccer, or football?'. We're creating awareness for it.""The key question, of course, is: is Smyth good enough to make it?""I feel like I am. I have a few adjustments to make but I definitely have the leg, the height on my kicks and the power and I feel like there's a few kickers who don't have that.""If I can keep developing and taking on the tips from the coaches, I feel like I can be in the better half of the kickers in the league. The standard is so high, it's unbelievable.""",767,Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/68761698
How Taylor Swift is helping flag football keep growing before Olympic debut,"Taylor Swift is proving to be American football's gift that keeps on giving.The global superstar's relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce lured scores of new fans to the USA's National Football League last season.Her presence at the Chiefs' Super Bowl win in February helped make it the most watched ever, with a record number of female viewers., externalFrom the UK to Australia, the American singer-songwriter is not just bringing new spectators to the sport, she is inspiring young girls to play it too.And that is helping one of the world's fastest growing sports - flag football - grow even faster before making its Olympic debut.After a failed attempt at inclusion for Tokyo 2020, the International Federation of American Football (Ifaf) agreed a partnership with the NFL, targeting Los Angeles 2028.In 2017 the NFL launched its own programme, external for flag football, the non-contact version of the game, and last October it was one of five sports added to the Olympic programme for 2028.""It's really special for a lot of young people, that they now can play at the pinnacle of sport and represent their country in flag football,"" former Great Britain player Afia Law, now NFL Flag's international development manager, told BBC Sport. Listen: Sportshour - How flag football became an Olympic sportFlag is the most inclusive and accessible form of American football. It is played by more than 20 million people, across more than 100 countries, and the rapid growth of the women's game was key to earning the Olympic vote.""Female participation has really been the driving force,"" said NFL analyst Phoebe Schecter, who has also played both flag and tackle football for Great Britain. ""People used to say that flag was a female sport whereas men would play tackle, but it's for everyone now. People see how explosive it is, the incredible contested catches, and it doesn't matter what your gender is, this is a place where you can just compete and have a great time.""Yet Great Britain's teams have not just been having a great time, they have been winning too. Schecter played on the women's team that became European champions last August, then helped coach the Under-17 girls as they also became European champions in September.There have been many obstacles for the current women's team. Kate Bruinvels had to set up a crowdfunding page, external to raise the £750 she needed to compete in Ireland last summer.Meanwhile, after discovering flag football at primary school, Kellie Barrett and her family formed their own club - the Coventry Cougars - so that she and her sister could keep playing.But Loughborough College now offers 10 flag football scholarships for male and female athletes aged 16-19, and the British game is set for a funding boost before the World Championships in August, for which Great Britain's women and men have qualified.""We've been successful without that help - how successful can we be with it?"" asked Britain captain Barrett.""My hope is that we're going through this hardship now, whereas any girls just starting to play won't have that barrier. They won't have to take on any financial burden.""The NFL Flag programme expanded in 2018 to the UK, where 500 schools and 30,000 players now participate in flag - 53% of them female. A girls league was also launched in London last year, expanding for its second season to 260 girls from 21 schools.And as well as going on to play for Britain, the most promising British youngsters can earn a free education through flag football, perhaps even a career.Flag is now a varsity sport in the US - for men and women - with college scholarships available for international student-athletes. A new professional men's league - the American Flag Football League, external - begins on 27 April, with a women's division set to launch in 2025.Even in Australia, many athletes are considering switching sports to flag football. One female ex-Australian Rules player has been offered a US scholarship after playing in just one international flag tournament.How did Taylor Swift's attendance influence the NFL's big game?Listen: Sportshour - Philadelphia Eagles' girls flag league and sports bra pledge""I've got two little girls, aged seven and eight, who love the game now,"" said Gridiron Australia chief executive Wade Kelly.""They love netball as well but now flag football's taking over. Taylor Swift maybe bumped that along a bit, but that's all they want to play now, down at the park or at the beach.""As a dad, to know they can go and get an education that's paid for in the US, see the world, go to the Olympics, maybe even turn pro - it's a legitimate pathway for them, and a really exciting one.""Flag football became an Olympic sport just three weeks after Taylor Swift attended her first Chiefs game.Since then, many UK flag teams such as the East Kilbride Pirates have reported a boom in awareness and interest, from newcomers and also from tackle players wanting to switch over.That isn't all down to the Taylor Swift effect, but there is no denying that it has reached far beyond the NFL arena.""People, especially young girls, are now aware of the sport in a way they never have been before,"" said East Kilbride's club chair Amanda McDonald.""It's amazing she's got people talking about it, which can only be good for the game and perhaps act as a gateway to get people involved who otherwise might not have.""For the first time, there's a pathway all the way to the podium.

"NFL free-agency: Kirk Cousins, Chris Jones and Derrick Henry among biggest 2024 deals","The NFL was back with a bang this week as its 32 teams started shaping their rosters for the 2024 season.Just over four weeks after the Kansas City Chiefs won their third Super Bowl in five years, the new league year officially got under way.It begins with the free agency period and this year it was a busy week, with more than 100 deals being agreed. Pittsburgh signing quarterbacks Russell Wilson and Justin Fields were the most high-profile moves but here are more of the biggest deals.Kirk Cousins has had to bide his time before becoming one of the NFL's top quarterbacks. An afterthought of a draft pick by Washington in 2012, he did not become their starter until his fourth year.After moving to Minnesota in 2018, he established himself as one of the NFL's most consistent passers, albeit more functional than flashy. Yet over the last couple of years, the seemingly strait-laced family man has also become an unlikely fans' favourite.Cousins was the star of the Quarterback series on Netflix, which followed him, Patrick Mahomes and Marcus Mariota during the 2022 season. And after a big away win, Cousins celebrated by going shirtless on the Vikings' flight home, dancing while covered in bling.Injury ended his 2023 season but the 35-year-old has now been lured to Atlanta with the biggest contract of his career - a four-year deal worth $180m (£141m). He will lead a vibrant young offence while last year's starter Desmond Ridder is heading to Arizona.While Patrick Mahomes again produced when it matters most for Kansas City, last season's Super Bowl run was actually built on the Chiefs' defence.Chris Jones is its leader, playing throughout the team's dynasty, and they recognised his importance by handing the 29-year-old a record deal for a defensive tackle - $158.75m (£124.7m) over five years.Rams defensive star Aaron Donald announces retirementAfter their Super Bowl epic in 2023, Philadelphia were on course for a rematch with Kansas City before suffering a late-season slump.Veteran centre Jason Kelce then retired but the Eagles have given themselves a boost by adding one of the NFL's best running backs to a team that already tends to have one of the league's best offensive lines and running games.Nicknamed 'Saquad' for the size of his thighs, Barkley was 2018's Offensive Rookie of the Year and has shown signs of getting back to his best over the last couple of seasons.He's been one of the Giants' few playmakers over the last six years so it was a surprise they let him go when he's still only 27. Barkley joins their divisional rivals on a three-year, $37.8m deal, while D'Andre Swift has left Philly for Chicago.""I'm pretty positive, even though a little bit upset [the Eagles] waited until I retired to make a move like this,"" Kelce said on his podcast. ""I knew I was going to miss an outstanding season for the Eagles, but I get to watch it and celebrate it just like everybody else, so I'm excited for that.""A battering ram of a running back, Derrick Henry has been the NFL's best since coming into the league in 2016, being named 2020's Offensive Player of the Year.But Tennessee are in the midst of a rebuild and running backs are thought to be in decline once they turn 30, as Henry did in January. Baltimore, though, felt the opportunity to sign a player who has been such a dominant force was too good to pass up.""He's kind of a unicorn,"" said Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta. ""It's a combination of speed, power, durability. Those kind of guys are rare.""Henry joins a team that had the NFL's best record in the regular season and will allow mobile quarterback Lamar Jackson, named Most Valuable Player for a second time, to save his legs for when he really needs to conjure some magic.After arriving on a two-year, $16m contract, Henry had a clear message for his doubters: ""Tell them to keep watching"".That Tennessee rebuild has seen the Titans sign running back Tony Pollard from Dallas to replace Henry, while adding quarterback Mason Rudolph from Pittsburgh.But their biggest deal was bringing in wide receiver Calvin Ridley, 29, from Jacksonville on a four-year, $92 contract.Another team in a rebuild is Washington and they have added a defensive leader in 33-year-old linebacker Bobby Wagner, who led the league for tackles last season.They brought in quarterback Marcus Mariota so let last season's starter Sam Howell join Seattle, and are expected to draft another QB with the second overall pick. They have also added pedigree to their offence with running back Austin Ekeler and tight end Zach Ertz.After playing for three teams in a year, Tampa Bay gave Baker Mayfield, 28, a chance to revive his career last season and he took advantage by leading them to the play-offs.They have rewarded 2018's number one draft pick with a three-year contract worth $100m and re-signed star receiver Mike Evans too.Las Vegas have bolstered their hard-nosed defence by signing tackle Christian Wilkins on a four-year, $110m deal. They have also brought in quarterback Gardner Minshew from Indianapolis so let Jimmy Garoppolo join the Los Angeles Rams.The Green Bay Packers made a surprise move by signing Josh Jacobs from the Raiders and letting fellow running back Aaron Jones join divisional rivals Minnesota, who have also brought in quarterback Sam Darnold from San Francisco to help replace Kirk Cousins.Last season showed the value in having reliable cover at quarterback, with more than 60 used as starters due to inconsistent form and injuries. Teams have been shuffling their pack before the draft (25-27 April), bringing in guys to compete for the starters' job or serve as back-ups, with some of those mentioned above involved in a quarterback merry-go-round.Other notable names on the move are Jameis Winston to Cleveland, Joe Flacco to Indianapolis, Jacoby Brissett to New England, Mac Jones to Jacksonville, Drew Lock to the Giants and Tyrod Taylor to the Jets.Get American Football alerts in the BBC Sport app",997,Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/68572226

That showing led to interest from the Saints.Although he has now joined the Louisiana franchise, Smyth is not guaranteed time on the field.Over the summer he has the opportunity to compete with last season's kicker Blake Grupe.NFL franchises can have 90 players on their roster throughout the off-season and that number is cut to 53 right before the start of the regular season, which will be the team's active roster.Those who miss out are either released or retained on the practice squad, where players can still earn sizeable salaries and be promoted to the active roster during the course of the season.From the 2024 season, which begins in September, all 32 NFL teams can have an additional spot on their practice squad for international players, including those who have come through the IPP, which aims to discover new talent and expand American football's global reach.Wales rugby union star Louis Rees-Zammit, who has signed with Super Bowl champions the Kansas City Chiefs, is another high-profile name from this year's IPP programme.In January, Green Bay Packers punter Dan Whelan became the first Irish-born player to play in the NFL playoffs for 41 years.",503,Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/68661901

15 Recipes Fit for a Cowboy
","
Get a taste of the fueling, fiery flavors of the West, with dishes cleverly (or cheekily) inspired by home on the range.

Whether you spend time on a ranch, are a fan of old Westerns or have been playing country music albums on repeat, you might have cowboys on the brain. Try one of these recipes  many of which offer meaty, Tex-Mex flavors  that seem to have been made with cowboys in mind. From Cowboy Cookies, which are as sweet as they are energy-packed, to easy-sipping Ranch Water, you dont have to be a cowboy to get a taste of the West.
Start with Cowboy Caviar. You can thank Oklahoma for this easy, bright and tangy salad. Its made with one of the states staple crops, black-eyed peas  or cowpeas as some in the Sooner State like to say. With bursts of corn, tomato and pepper, it's a salad that can be served cold or at room temperature, making it perfect for a picnic or tailgate party.

Rees recipe for a big pot of beans is a little sweet, a little spicy and a lot satisfying. This classic cowboy side is made with a bit of bacon for heft, and chili powder for some zip and color. A generous helping of these thickly sauced pinto beans will keep you powered through the day.

This simple drink traces its roots to Austin though there are several stories claiming its exact origins. Just stir together tequila blanco and fresh lime juice, then top with sparkling mineral water for an ultra-refreshing drink, especially on a hot day.

Butter requires very little to make it taste delicious, but in this recipe, the herbs, garlic and chile take it over the top. You can use Rees Cowboy Butter for mashed potatoes, or spread it on freshly baked bread.

The gnocchi are finished with a simple dusting of Parm and fresh for a fresh and satisfying vegetarian main dish.

Broil  instead of boil  gnocchi in this quick sheet pan dinner. Peppers, onions, tomatoes and sausage are the perfect bed for the little potato dumplings, which are crusted with Parmesan and broiled until crispy and tender.

Store-bought gnocchi is pretty much the perfect food because it goes so well with any cooked vegetables and can be made in one saucepan--no waiting for a separate pot of water to come to a boil. We love the combination with mushrooms (which is even easier when you start with our big-batch Meal-Prep Roasted Mushrooms). The Parmesan, butter and olive oil come together into a rich and creamy sauce--all in less than 15 minutes.

31 French Recipes That Will Make You Feel Like a Gourmet Chef
","
From the rich layers of a buttery fish recipe to the comforting warmth of a delicate egg dish, theres a French recipe on our list thats bound to pique your curiosityand taste buds.

Of all the worlds cuisines, few have come to symbolize gourmet cooking and desserts quite like the food of France. The country is renowned for its exquisite stews and soups, salads and casseroles, each telling a story of tradition and terroir. Ratatouille, souffles, crêpes and more: French cuisine teaches the importance of technique and the joy of quality ingredients, making every dish a celebration. By perfecting a few classics, you can bring the elegance and depth of French culinary arts into your kitchen. An essential recipe to add to your repertoire is rich coq au vin. Pieces of skin-on, bone-in chicken braise for hours with mushrooms and carrots, plus a generous pour of dry red wine.


A velvety French omelette takes a skilled hand to perfect, but only a handful of staple ingredients to make. The trick is all in the techniqueusing gentle heat and small circular movements to get the eggs to set just right.

Homemade croissants may seem intimidating to pull off at home, but if you follow the instructions perfectly, you will end up with a buttery, flaky pastry that rivals the ones you find at top-notch bakeries. The trick is managing the temperature of the butter as you fold it between layers, so dont hesitate to pop the dough in the refrigerator for a few minutes in between steps to keep it from melting.

Once you perfect the art of the airy soufflé, theres no recipe you cant pull off. This version is savory, full of delicate herbs and shredded Fontina cheese.

24 Tater Tot Recipes That Will Make You Glad You've Got a Bag in the Freezer
","
This family-favorite staple is more versatile than you might think.

Potato tots are a comforting frozen food that are beloved by kids and adults alike. Whether you pop some in the microwave for a quick and easy side dish or heat them up in the oven and pile them with cheesy toppings for a crowd-pleasing appetizer, these crunchy, golden treats are more versatile than you might think (tot-topped casserole, anyone?). No matter how you prepare them, theyre a breeze to make and sure to be enjoyed.
One of our favorite ways to use them? In this version of tot-chos (tater tot nachos!). Molly borrows flavors inspired by elote, the Mexican street corn that's covered in mayo, chili powder, Cotija and lime to create something newand just as crave-worthy. The dish is super easy and packed with a ton of bold, vibrant flavors to make each bite even more memorable than the last.

If you love chicken and waffles, you will absolutely swoon over this savory take on the classic dish. Instead of sweet, doughy waffles, this recipe uses frozen tater tots that get pressed into a waffle shape before being drizzled with hot sauce and honey. Top it all off with crispy chicken for an irresistible dish thats perfect for breakfast, brunch or dinner.

This heartwarming dish is a one-pot-wonderits packed with filling ingredients like ground pork shoulder and root vegetables, all of which get topped off with crispy tater tots. The comforting bowl of soul food is full of flavor from ingredients like lemongrass, ginger, kaffir lime and red curry paste. For an extra-crispy topping, be sure to pop this hot dish under the broiler for five minutes before serving.

This recipe takes your game day sliders to the next level by swapping in tater tots instead of classic buns. The result is a crunchy, crispy layer thats salty and irresistible. Layer them with your favorite sandwich fixins and serve with ketchup, mayo or mustard for dipping.

61 Vegetarian Recipes Everyone Will Love

Going meatless? These hearty, veggie-packed dishes make it easy to put a flavorful meal on the table any night of the week.

When you need to find vegetarian recipes, look no further. We have plenty of healthy meatless dishes, easy options and even vegan recipes thatll satisfy you  and your whole family. You wont need to worry about whether youre getting enough protein, either; these dishes are loaded with plant-based proteins to keep you satiated. Make veggie burgers, a hearty vegetarian chili and even comfort food favorites, all without the meat! This kung pao cauliflower proves even traditionally meat-filled dishes can be made vegetarian and filled with flavor.

This vegan recipe is a wonderful alternative to classic beef bourguignon (and is fast, too). Dried porcinis are soaked to create a flavorful, earthy broth. Next, meaty mushrooms are browned to perfection, then added to a rich wine sauce along with carrots and the star of the show, cannellini beans, which soak up all the flavors as they simmer and naturally thicken the sauce so you can skip the usual flour. Served over herbed pasta, this dish is ideal for chilly nights when you crave a satisfying and cozy stick-to-your-ribs stew.

There's nothing better than a smooth, creamy sauce to pour over pasta for a cheesy, comforting dish! The butternut squash really makes this look like cheese sauce, the cashews make it super creamy and the nutritional yeast gives it the cheesy flavor. 

Black beans and walnuts create the base for these tasty vegan tostadas. They're made with crispy gluten-free organic corn tortillas and topped with crunchy pepitas, sweet yellow corn and red bell peppers.

91 Instant Pot Recipes to Add to Your Rotation
","
There are so many reasons to love your multicookerlike all these mouthwatering recipes that were made just for the trendy, all-in-one appliance.

Theres no denying that an Instant Pot® is a must-have for every kitchen. Whats not to love about a slow-cooker, pressure cooker and stovetop stand-in all wrapped into one compact appliance? With a few accessories and the right recipes, your multicooker can get cozy soups, crowd-pleasing chicken dinners, healthy weeknight meals and even desserts on the table with ease. Ready to put your Instant Pot® to good use? Youre in the right place  weve got plenty of delicious options for you to choose from.

Meaty, rice-based jambalaya is both a restaurant standard and a home-cooking favorite in New Orleans and beyond. Cooking all the ingredients together, including the various proteins and the rice, can take a few hours. Here we get a full-flavored jambalaya on your dinner table in less than 40 minutes with help from the Instant Pot®. This recipe is inspired by a red or Creole jambalaya thanks to the addition of tomatoes to the pot. A classic combination of shrimp, andouille sausage and chicken thighs are browned along with the holy trinity of onion, celery and bell pepper. Rice, tomato and broth are added, and the pressure cycle makes quick work of cooking everything together with the long-grain rice for the deep, rich flavor thats a hallmark of the dish.

There are countless versions of the comfort-classic chili mac, a dish that at its most basic is chili (usually meat chili) combined with elbow macaroni. This version is inspired by the flavors of Texas chilicubed beef, chiles, spice and no beans. Traditional Texas chili takes hours to achieve its super-tender beef and famous long-simmered flavor, so we turned to the pressure cooker to help bring it together quickly. We also brought in that creamy queso-dip secret ingredient, processed cheese, for a perfect velvety finish to our dish.

You can make hearty stuffed peppers without the long bake time, thanks to your Instant Pot! Just build the ground beef and rice filling in the Instant Pot itself, then stuff into large bell peppers and pressure-cook until perfectly tender. Finish off with some extra-sharp Cheddar and chopped parsley for a great weeknight meal.

57 Sheet Pan Recipes That Make Cooking (and Cleanup) Easier
","
The humble sheet pan is one of the strongest workhorses in the kitchen.

Whether you're looking for big-batch recipes that can feed a crowd or something akin to a one-pot meal that makes cleanup easier, there's no better piece of cookware to reach for than your trust baking sheet. Breakfast, lunch, dinner and even dessertjust about any recipe can be turned into a no-fuss tray bake. One of our favorites? This vegetarian chili that's topped with simple, cornbread biscuits. It's comforting, satisfying and so easy to makeleaving you plenty of time to tackle something else from your to-do list.

A sheet pan meal thats impressive enough for company, but easy enough for a weeknight. This version goes perfectly with crusty garlic-Parmesan bread for dipping.

Main and side dishes cook together for a quick and easy weeknight meal. Broil pork chops to achieve a crispy texture on the outside but maintain moisture inside.

Skip the messy process of frying eggplant and bake it on a sheet pan instead. The thick slices get the same crisp exterior and soft interior, but you'll use a lot less oil, making for a healthy dinner that only tastes indulgent.

60 Easy and Delicious Air Fryer Recipes
","
From homemade chicken tenders and crispy Brussels sprouts to complete meals in minutes, you wont believe all the things you can cook in this handy countertop appliance.

When we think about all of the reasons to love the air fryer, versatility is always at the top of our list. You can use it to make easy appetizers, dinnertime mains, veggies to serve alongside and even chocolate chip cookies for dessert. And, although not everything made in the air fryer is automatically healthy, plenty of your favorites can be made with less fat and oil by utilizing this smart countertop appliance. Youll be surprised at how many different foods you can make in it. You cant go wrong with any of the recipes in this roundup but these kid-friendly chicken fingers are a good place to start. Theyre a healthier alternative to the ones you order from your local pizzeriaand guaranteed to please young and old alike.

Pomegranate lends its sweet-tart essence and ruby hue to this impressive weeknight dinner or special-occasion main dish in two ways: First, pomegranate molasses is the base of a fruity glaze for the salmon fillets, resulting in perfectly caramelized exteriors. While the fish cooks, we toss together a bold and colorful relish of pomegranate arils, cilantro and spicy serrano chiles to cut through the richness of the salmon. And since it's ready in just about 20 minutes, you'll have plenty of time for your guests or family.

The secret to making air fryer zucchini super crispy is a generous amount of olive oil in the breading. The oil helps to mimic the same crunchy crust youd get from deep-frying, but without the mess. We like to serve fried zucchini with warm marinara sauce, but these bites would be equally delicious (and a bit more indulgent) dipped in creamy ranch dressing or your favorite aioli.

This clever recipe uses silicone ice cube stick molds to quickly create the components for breakfast tacos in an air fryer. One mold holds corn tortillas in a U-shape so they transform into hard taco shells while they cook. Another mold holds beaten eggs, which cook at the same time as the tortillas. Pop the finished ""scrambled"" eggs out of the mold, then stuff them into the cheese-filled taco shells. Add some spicy mayo, tomatoes and avocado and the result is an extra-crispy, extra-tasty breakfast treat.

94 Slow Cooker Recipes to Make in Your Crock Pot®

This handy countertop appliance is our go-to for soups and fork-tender roastsbut its perfect for everything from bread to desserts, too.

The slow cooker is surprisingly versatile. We rely on it for comfort food season (think soups and stews, hearty chilis and fork-tender roasts) as well as Sunday dinnerslike meatballs and red sauce with that simmered-all-day flavor. But, this handy countertop appliance can do so much more. Its capable of cooking chicken in so many different ways, can produce a fluffy loaf of no-rise bread and is essential when you need to get a healthy meal on the table without too much effort. It can even be used to make dessert! All you need to make the most of your slow cooker is the right recipeslike these irresistible chicken thighs. Soy sauce, honey, garlic and ginger (along with the natural juices of the chicken) create a flavorful sauce to serve over chicken thighs and rice. If you like a thicker sauce, simply add cornstarch at the end and cook a little longer.

If you have yet to cook beans from scratch and own a slow cooker, this is the recipe for you! It comes together with pantry ingredients, requires minimal prep and thanks to the slow cooker, youll be rewarded with plump, perfectly tender beans with almost zero hands-on time. (Navy beans would also work well here.) Seasoned with warm spices and pickled jalapenos, they are a great side dish. Or serve them over rice or with warm tortillas as a meal

Enjoy this simple cozy recipe with the flip of a switch. With a few easy-to-find ingredients and minimal prep, you can enjoy a pork chop dinner for four. Serve with creamy grits or buttered rice for a filling family meal.

These meatballs taste just like your nonnas without any pre-cooking or tending tojust throw them in the slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients. The recipe makes enough meatballs and sauce to serve with two pounds of pasta. They are also delicious over polenta, stuffed into sub rolls or as a pizza topping.

Whether you tackle a good, old-fashioned Sunday supper or a simple weeknight meal, it feels like the dirty pots, pans and plates always pile up fast. Thats where these one-pot wonders come in.

What could be easier?

You can't go wrong with Tyler's macaroni and cheese. He uses cheddar and Parmesan to play up the classic flavors. Bake in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes for a perfect golden crust.
