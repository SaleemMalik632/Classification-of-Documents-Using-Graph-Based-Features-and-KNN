75 Spring Weeknight Dinners That Are Fresh and Flavorful
","
From satisfying mains (that are a little lighter and brighter) to easy sides made with the season’s best veggies, these quick and simple recipes are perfect for celebrating the change of season.

Spring has sprung and, along with it, a bounty of fresh produce that’s perfect for family weeknight dinners. Tender spears of asparagus, flavorful artichokes, and stalks of oh-so-versatile rhubarb are all ready and waiting to supplement the cold-weather staples you still have stocked in your kitchen. We couldn’t be more excited about the new season (and new recipes for the rotation!) so we’ve rounded up all our best ideas, starting with this lighter, brighter take on a family favorite: golden-brown chicken cutlets. With a rich, creamy sauce and fresh spring peas, this dish is the perfect representation of the transition from winter to spring.

          Spring vegetables brighten up classic pasta Alfredo, while lemon zest and chives cut the rich creaminess.
        
Gribiche is a dressing made of hard-boiled eggs and lots of punchy, acidic flavors. All those elements translate to a tasty sauce that takes roasted asparagus to unbelievable new heights—plus nicely balances the richness of a charred steak like London broil. You'll need to set a little time aside for marinating but this easy sheet pan supper comes together quickly once that's done, making it doable on weeknights.

Whether you’re vegetarian or simply looking for more meatless meals to add to your weekly rotation, this coconut-crusted tofu is sure to please. It comes together in under an hour and has tons of sweet-and-savory flavor, making it perfect for feeding the family on a busy weeknight.

15 Recipes Fit for a Cowboy
","
Get a taste of the fueling, fiery flavors of the West, with dishes cleverly (or cheekily) inspired by home on the range.

Whether you spend time on a ranch, are a fan of old Westerns or have been playing country music albums on repeat, you might have cowboys on the brain. Try one of these recipes – many of which offer meaty, Tex-Mex flavors – that seem to have been made with cowboys in mind. From Cowboy Cookies, which are as sweet as they are energy-packed, to easy-sipping Ranch Water, you don’t have to be a cowboy to get a taste of the West.
Start with Cowboy Caviar. You can thank Oklahoma for this easy, bright and tangy salad. It’s made with one of the state’s staple crops, black-eyed peas – or cowpeas as some in the “Sooner State” like to say. With bursts of corn, tomato and pepper, it's a salad that can be served cold or at room temperature, making it perfect for a picnic or tailgate party.

Ree’s recipe for a big pot of beans is a little sweet, a little spicy and a lot satisfying. This “classic cowboy side” is made with a bit of bacon for heft, and chili powder for some zip and color. A generous helping of these thickly sauced pinto beans will keep you powered through the day.

This simple drink traces its roots to Austin though there are several stories claiming its exact origins. Just stir together tequila blanco and fresh lime juice, then top with sparkling mineral water for an ultra-refreshing drink, especially on a hot day.

Butter requires very little to make it taste delicious, but in this recipe, the herbs, garlic and chile take it over the top. You can use Ree’s Cowboy Butter for mashed potatoes, or spread it on freshly baked bread.

This rustic omelet isn’t what one typically pictures when thinking of a French omelet. It’s thick, hearty and packed with hearty potatoes and bacon. This filling dish is a one-pot wonder when you need to feed a house full of hungry breakfast guests.

In Lebanon, ejjeh is a popular breakfast omelet made by whisking eggs with fresh herbs and green onions and a little flour to create an egg wrap. In this recipe, the wrap is stuffed with lemony mashed potatoes that make it extra hearty, filling and flavorful.

Ready in just ten minutes, this easy omelet is puffed to perfection thanks to a hot pan that’s been warmed in the broiler. Folded with cheddar, gruyere and parmesan, the simple dish is packed with flavor crispy, creamy texture. Top with chopped fine herbs like chives, tarragon or parsley.

27 Gnocchi Recipes for Dinners Everyone Will Love
","
Want to upgrade your pasta night? Fluffy and tender gnocchi will certainly do the trick. Whether you want to whip up your own or make the most of a store-bought version, these gnocchi recipes are sure to satisfy your carb cravings.

Gnocchi has to be one of our all-time-favorite comfort foods. Made with just a few ingredients (usually potato, flour and eggs) these pillowy dumplings deliver all the satisfaction of a 5-star pasta dish, but with the added bonus of an almost creamy texture. When made correctly they’re light as air, yet completely filling and satisfying. There are plenty of variations, too—including gnocchi made with ricotta cheese, sweet potatoes and even cauliflower but nothing beats the classic. You will be pleasantly surprised at how easily you can turn them out at home. These homemade gnocchi work well with pesto or red sauce—but are also irresistible just tossed with butter.

Pillowy potato gnocchi are quintessential comfort food and easy to make from scratch. We took them up a notch by stuffing each little pasta-like dumpling with a filling inspired by the popular spinach-and-artichoke dip. A final lemon, butter and garlic sauce makes them particularly luxurious. The filling comes together quickly in a food processor and features three cheeses (mozzarella, Parmesan and cream cheese) to remind you of the classic dip. The gnocchi are finished with a simple dusting of Parm and fresh for a fresh and satisfying vegetarian main dish.

Broil — instead of boil — gnocchi in this quick sheet pan dinner. Peppers, onions, tomatoes and sausage are the perfect bed for the little potato dumplings, which are crusted with Parmesan and broiled until crispy and tender.

Store-bought gnocchi is pretty much the perfect food because it goes so well with any cooked vegetables and can be made in one saucepan--no waiting for a separate pot of water to come to a boil. We love the combination with mushrooms (which is even easier when you start with our big-batch Meal-Prep Roasted Mushrooms). The Parmesan, butter and olive oil come together into a rich and creamy sauce--all in less than 15 minutes.

Of all the world’s cuisines, few have come to symbolize gourmet cooking and desserts quite like the food of France. The country is renowned for its exquisite stews and soups, salads and casseroles, each telling a story of tradition and terroir. Ratatouille, souffles, crêpes and more: French cuisine teaches the importance of technique and the joy of quality ingredients, making every dish a celebration. By perfecting a few classics, you can bring the elegance and depth of French culinary arts into your kitchen. An essential recipe to add to your repertoire is rich coq au vin. Pieces of skin-on, bone-in chicken braise for hours with mushrooms and carrots, plus a generous pour of dry red wine.


A velvety French omelette takes a skilled hand to perfect, but only a handful of staple ingredients to make. The trick is all in the technique—using gentle heat and small circular movements to get the eggs to set just right.

Homemade croissants may seem intimidating to pull off at home, but if you follow the instructions perfectly, you will end up with a buttery, flaky pastry that rivals the ones you find at top-notch bakeries. The trick is managing the temperature of the butter as you fold it between layers, so don’t hesitate to pop the dough in the refrigerator for a few minutes in between steps to keep it from melting.

No matter how you prepare them, they’re a breeze to make and sure to be enjoyed.
One of our favorite ways to use them? In this version of tot-chos (tater tot nachos!). Molly borrows flavors inspired by elote, the Mexican street corn that's covered in mayo, chili powder, Cotija and lime to create something new—and just as crave-worthy. The dish is super easy and packed with a ton of bold, vibrant flavors to make each bite even more memorable than the last.

If you love chicken and waffles, you will absolutely swoon over this savory take on the classic dish. Instead of sweet, doughy waffles, this recipe uses frozen tater tots that get pressed into a waffle shape before being drizzled with hot sauce and honey. Top it all off with crispy chicken for an irresistible dish that’s perfect for breakfast, brunch or dinner.

This heartwarming dish is a one-pot-wonder—it’s packed with filling ingredients like ground pork shoulder and root vegetables, all of which get topped off with crispy tater tots. The comforting bowl of soul food is full of flavor from ingredients like lemongrass, ginger, kaffir lime and red curry paste.

Make veggie burgers, a hearty vegetarian chili and even comfort food favorites, all without the meat! This kung pao cauliflower proves even traditionally meat-filled dishes can be made vegetarian and filled with flavor.

This vegan recipe is a wonderful alternative to classic beef bourguignon (and is fast, too). Dried porcinis are soaked to create a flavorful, earthy broth. Next, meaty mushrooms are browned to perfection, then added to a rich wine sauce along with carrots and the star of the show, cannellini beans, which soak up all the flavors as they simmer and naturally thicken the sauce so you can skip the usual flour. Served over herbed pasta, this dish is ideal for chilly nights when you crave a satisfying and cozy stick-to-your-ribs stew.

There's nothing better than a smooth, creamy sauce to pour over pasta for a cheesy, comforting dish! The butternut squash really makes this look like cheese sauce, the cashews make it super creamy and the nutritional yeast gives it the cheesy flavor. 

Black beans and walnuts create the base for these tasty vegan tostadas. They're made with crispy gluten-free organic corn tortillas and topped with crunchy pepitas, sweet yellow corn and red bell peppers.

91 Instant Pot Recipes to Add to Your Rotation
","
There are so many reasons to love your multicooker—like all these mouthwatering recipes that were made just for the trendy, all-in-one appliance.

There’s no denying that an Instant Pot® is a must-have for every kitchen. What’s not to love about a slow-cooker, pressure cooker and stovetop stand-in all wrapped into one compact appliance? With a few accessories and the right recipes, your multicooker can get cozy soups, crowd-pleasing chicken dinners, healthy weeknight meals and even desserts on the table with ease. Ready to put your Instant Pot® to good use? You’re in the right place — we’ve got plenty of delicious options for you to choose from.

Meaty, rice-based jambalaya is both a restaurant standard and a home-cooking favorite in New Orleans and beyond. Cooking all the ingredients together, including the various proteins and the rice, can take a few hours. Here we get a full-flavored jambalaya on your dinner table in less than 40 minutes with help from the Instant Pot®. This recipe is inspired by a “red” or Creole jambalaya thanks to the addition of tomatoes to the pot. A classic combination of shrimp, andouille sausage and chicken thighs are browned along with the “holy trinity” of onion, celery and bell pepper. Rice, tomato and broth are added, and the pressure cycle makes quick work of cooking everything together with the long-grain rice for the deep, rich flavor that’s a hallmark of the dish.

There are countless versions of the comfort-classic chili mac, a dish that at its most basic is chili (usually meat chili) combined with elbow macaroni. This version is inspired by the flavors of Texas chili—cubed beef, chiles, spice and no beans. Traditional Texas chili takes hours to achieve its super-tender beef and famous long-simmered flavor, so we turned to the pressure cooker to help bring it together quickly. We also brought in that creamy queso-dip secret ingredient, processed cheese, for a perfect velvety finish to our dish.

You can make hearty stuffed peppers without the long bake time, thanks to your Instant Pot! Just build the ground beef and rice filling in the Instant Pot itself, then stuff into large bell peppers and pressure-cook until perfectly tender. Finish off with some extra-sharp Cheddar and chopped parsley for a great weeknight meal.

57 Sheet Pan Recipes That Make Cooking (and Cleanup) Easier

The humble sheet pan is one of the strongest workhorses in the kitchen.

Whether you're looking for big-batch recipes that can feed a crowd or something akin to a one-pot meal that makes cleanup easier, there's no better piece of cookware to reach for than your trust baking sheet. Breakfast, lunch, dinner and even dessert—just about any recipe can be turned into a no-fuss tray bake. One of our favorites? This vegetarian chili that's topped with simple, cornbread biscuits. It's comforting, satisfying and so easy to make—leaving you plenty of time to tackle something else from your to-do list.

A sheet pan meal that’s impressive enough for company, but easy enough for a weeknight. This version goes perfectly with crusty garlic-Parmesan bread for dipping.

Main and side dishes cook together for a quick and easy weeknight meal. Broil pork chops to achieve a crispy texture on the outside but maintain moisture inside.

Skip the messy process of frying eggplant and bake it on a sheet pan instead. The thick slices get the same crisp exterior and soft interior, but you'll use a lot less oil, making for a healthy dinner that only tastes indulgent.

60 Easy and Delicious Air Fryer Recipes
","
From homemade chicken tenders and crispy Brussels sprouts to complete meals in minutes, you won’t believe all the things you can cook in this handy countertop appliance.

When we think about all of the reasons to love the air fryer, versatility is always at the top of our list. You can use it to make easy appetizers, dinnertime mains, veggies to serve alongside and even chocolate chip cookies for dessert. And, although not everything made in the air fryer is automatically healthy, plenty of your favorites can be made with less fat and oil by utilizing this smart countertop appliance. You’ll be surprised at how many different foods you can make in it. You can’t go wrong with any of the recipes in this roundup but these kid-friendly chicken fingers are a good place to start. They’re a healthier alternative to the ones you order from your local pizzeria—and guaranteed to please young and old alike.

Pomegranate lends its sweet-tart essence and ruby hue to this impressive weeknight dinner or special-occasion main dish in two ways: First, pomegranate molasses is the base of a fruity glaze for the salmon fillets, resulting in perfectly caramelized exteriors. While the fish cooks, we toss together a bold and colorful relish of pomegranate arils, cilantro and spicy serrano chiles to cut through the richness of the salmon. And since it's ready in just about 20 minutes, you'll have plenty of time for your guests or family.

The secret to making air fryer zucchini super crispy is a generous amount of olive oil in the breading. The oil helps to mimic the same crunchy crust you’d get from deep-frying, but without the mess. We like to serve fried zucchini with warm marinara sauce, but these bites would be equally delicious (and a bit more indulgent) dipped in creamy ranch dressing or your favorite aioli.

This clever recipe uses silicone ice cube stick molds to quickly create the components for breakfast tacos in an air fryer. One mold holds corn tortillas in a U-shape so they transform into hard taco shells while they cook. Another mold holds beaten eggs, which cook at the same time as the tortillas. Pop the finished ""scrambled"" eggs out of the mold, then stuff them into the cheese-filled taco shells. Add some spicy mayo, tomatoes and avocado and the result is an extra-crispy, extra-tasty breakfast treat.
